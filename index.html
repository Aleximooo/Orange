	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>My name is Alex Wright, and I'm a cellist of 12 years and music producer of 9. </li>
		<li><strong>I graduate from Berklee CoM class of '25.</strong> </li>
		<li>I like to cook, exercise, and paint. </li>
		<li>My advice for my past self would be to talk to more people, because <br>
		being mysterious is worth it for only a while, but it won't pay your tuition <br>
		for the next 15 years. </li>
	</ul>
