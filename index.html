	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Alex Wright, and I'm a cellist of 12 years and producer of 9. <br> 
		I graduate from Berklee CoM class of '25. I like to cook, exercise, and paint. <br>
		My advice for my past self would be to talk to more people, because <br>
		Being mysterious is worth it for only a while, but it won't pay your tuition <br>
		for the next 15 years. </p>
