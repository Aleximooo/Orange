		About
	</h1>
	
	<blockquote>
	My name is Alex Wright, and I’m a musician hailing from Orange, Connecticut. I’m a cellist and
producer with an interest in session work, sound design, and composition.
I attended Berklee as a cellist, where I earned the Berklee Contemporary Symphony Orchestra
award under the guidance of Julius P. Williams. I’ve also played for various student projects under the
Screen Scoring Program, and in various club performances. I studied under the Electronic Production &
Design Major. 
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
	In studying my major, I worked with music tech and sound design/engineering, and became
ingrained with programs such as Ableton Live, ProTools, MaxforLive, and VS Code. I hope to become a
working professional on both sides of the recording booth, and would like to explore more of the audio
engineering field. Additionally, I’d like to produce and compose my own works, professionally.
